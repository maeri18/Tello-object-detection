This contains the python scripts representing the publisher node (camera_publisher.py) and the subscriber node (sub1.py and not camera_subscriber.py) for this project.

The *backups* directory is contains files that are backups we used while developping the application. So most of them won't work.

The *test_fails* directory also contains files we developped but that contains important bugs.

Finally, *test_publisher_subscriber* directory contains two files we used while installing ROS to test that the publisher and subscriber architecture works well on our computer.

The file *camera_subscriber.py* is a subscriber node that reads camera frames from the video and prints them on the screen without detection.
